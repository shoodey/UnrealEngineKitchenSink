# Unreal Engine - Kitchen Sink

This is a sandbox for building and testing Unreal Engine 5 plugins.

The goal is to have a single project that contains all the plugins I'm working on, so I can test them with minimal 
effort.
It can also serve as showcase for these plugins.

## Private Access

While this repository is public, the plugins it contains are private. You can't access them directly. Please message 
me if you are interested in any of them. The goal is to publish them on the FAB marketplace eventually.

## C++ first, Blueprint accessible

The plugins are built with C++ first, but they are designed to be accessible from Blueprints. The goal is to provide
a good balance between performance and ease of use.
